This is a sample working paper created to test the new Working Papers section. It demonstrates how working papers will be displayed in the dedicated section between Publications and Teaching. The section uses the same layout and functionality as the Publications section but is specifically for papers that are still in progress or under review.

The working papers section includes all the same features:

- Abstract toggle functionality
- Author highlighting for George Melios
- Links for DOI, BIB, CODE, and PDF
- Responsive design
- Same styling as publications but with "Working Paper" as the default journal designation.
